I build intelligent collaborative agents that model, learn, and reason about their human collaborators. My research advances methods for complex sequential decision making, intelligent agent systems, as well as hybrid AI agent architectures built with statistical machine learning and knowledge-rich inference algorithms. I leverage insights from economics, psychology, education, and HCI to desgin effective and robust human-agent collaboration in real-world settings. 

As a Principal Investigator at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/), I lead technology and business development for AI research. My work spans fundamental algorithmic advances in agent architectures as well applications of agent technology in real world usecases. 

__Fundamental Agent Research__: I lead research on open-world learning agents ([DARPA SAIL-ON](https://intelligencecommunitynews.com/darpa-introduces-sail-on-program/)) and on teachable agents ([DARPA GAILA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/grounded-artificial-intelligence-language-acquisition)). Both these efforts study how agents can adapt to new situations after they are operational without the need of taking them offline and re-training. I study the role of structured representations in efficient & resilient agent architectures and investigate how they can be manipulated or adapted efficiently on-the-fly.     

__Agent Applications__: I have designed interactive, collaborative agents for a variety of domains including [patient-centric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00234), [preventative](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501) [healthcare](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [sustainable](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352) [living](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3563357.3567404), [general](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9515448) [purpose](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPaper/17261) [robots](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), and [augmented reality](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2327/IUI19WS-USER2AGENT-1.pdf). I am particularly motivated to build intelligent collaborative technology [social good and public welfare](https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/AI-for-Social-Good-Workshop-Report.pdf). 

My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence ([AIJ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0004370224000973), [JAIR](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352), [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), [IAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI17/paper/viewPaper/14963)), human cognition ([ICCM](https://iccm-conference.github.io/), [ACS](http://cogsys.org/journal/volume2/article-2-9.pdf), [BICA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212683X14000164)), human-machine interaction ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3375790) [TiiS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [IEEE RO-MAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9515448)) as well as in applications ([JMIR](https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/), [EMBC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7591428), [ACM/AAAI AIES](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271)).
