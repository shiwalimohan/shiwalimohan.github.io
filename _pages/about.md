Hi! I am an AI scientist with over a decade of experience in intelligent systems research & development. I:  

* Build intelligent agents - computational entities that make decisions and take actions, sequentially and over a long time horizon, to achieve a desirable outcome. 

* Design agent architectures & frameworks with components for knowledge-rich reasoning (AI planning, knowledge representation & reasoning, cognitive architectures) and statistical machine learning (computer vision, large language models, deep learning). 

* Am passionate about agentic technology that supports people in problem solving, decision making, and learning. I draw inspiration from social sciences - economics, psychology, education, and human-computer interaction - in agent systems for effective human-agent collaboration. 

I am experienced principal investigator, having worked with various US government funding agencies including DARPA, AFOSR, ARPA-E, and NSF/NIH. My science contributions include fundamental advances in agent architectures as well as application of agent technology to real world usecases.


__Fundamental Research__: I led research on open-world learning agents ([DARPA SAIL-ON](https://intelligencecommunitynews.com/darpa-introduces-sail-on-program/)) and on teachable agents ([DARPA GAILA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/grounded-artificial-intelligence-language-acquisition)). Both these efforts study how agents can adapt to new situations, post-deployment, without the need of taking them offline and re-training. I study the role of structured representations in resilient agent architectures and investigate how they can be manipulated or adapted efficiently on-the-fly autonomously and with human instruction.       

__Applications__: I have built interactive, collaborative agents for a variety of domains including [patient-centric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00234), [preventative](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501) [healthcare](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [sustainable](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352) [living](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3563357.3567404), [general](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9515448) [purpose](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPaper/17261) [robots](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), and [augmented reality](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2327/IUI19WS-USER2AGENT-1.pdf). 

My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence ([AIJ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0004370224000973), [JAIR](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352), [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), [IAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI17/paper/viewPaper/14963)), human cognition ([ICCM](https://iccm-conference.github.io/), [ACS](http://cogsys.org/journal/volume2/article-2-9.pdf), [BICA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212683X14000164)), human-machine interaction ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3375790) [TiiS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [IEEE RO-MAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9515448)) as well as in applications ([JMIR](https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/), [EMBC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7591428), [ACM/AAAI AIES](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271)).
