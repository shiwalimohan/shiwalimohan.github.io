I am a scientist with 15 years of experience in AI research & development.  I:  

* Build [intelligent agents](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/aima1e/chapter02.pdf). In AI science, an agent is a computational entity that perceives its environment, evaluates a decision, and takes an action sequentially, to achieve a desirable outcome. 

* Design [agent architectures and frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_architecture) for complex autonomy.  My expertise is in hetrogenous architectures that bring together the two diverse philosophies of AI; [knowledge-based reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems) (AI planning, knowledge representation & reasoning, cognitive architectures) and [data-driven machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (computer vision, large language models, deep learning). These two philosophies are complimentary in nature - knowledge-based reasoning is reliable and explicable while data-driven machine learning is robust to noise and uncertainty. 

* Am passionate about agent technology that [supports people](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05406) in problem solving, decision making, and learning. I draw upon insights from social sciences - economics, psychology, education, and human-computer interaction - to build agents that collaborate with people effectively. 

I am experienced principal investigator and have worked with various US government funding agencies including DARPA, AFOSR, ARPA-E, and NSF/NIH. My science contributions include fundamental advances in agent architectures as well as application of agent technology to real world usecases. My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence ([AIJ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0004370224000973), [JAIR](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352), [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), [IAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI17/paper/viewPaper/14963)), human cognition ([ICCM](https://iccm-conference.github.io/), [ACS](http://cogsys.org/journal/volume2/article-2-9.pdf), [BICA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212683X14000164)), human-machine interaction ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3375790) [TiiS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [IEEE RO-MAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9515448)) as well as in applications ([JMIR](https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/), [EMBC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7591428), [ACM/AAAI AIES](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271)).
