I am a scientist with 15 years of experience in AI research & development.  I:  

* Build [intelligent agents](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/aima1e/chapter02.pdf). 'AI agents' are all the hype right now and the term 'agent' has been co-opted to mean very different things. In AI science, an agent is a computational entity that given perception, makes decisions, and takes actions, sequentially, and over a long time horizon, to achieve a desirable outcome. The science of agents studies how informed decisions are made, how learning new knowledge affects decisions, how knowledge is represented etc. Agents have been central to AI & ML research since the [term 'AI' was first coined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop)!   

* Design [agent architectures and frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_architecture) to organize inference, reasoning, learning, and control to enable autonomous behavior. My expertise is in hetrogenous architectures that bring together the two diverse philosophies of AI; knowledge-based reasoning (AI planning, knowledge representation & reasoning, cognitive architectures) and data-driven machine learning (computer vision, large language models, deep learning). These two philosophies are complimentary in nature - knowledge-based reasoning is reliable and explicable while data-driven machine learning handles noise and uncertainty. This is why building heterogenous architectures is fun!

* Am passionate about agentic technology that supports people in problem solving, decision making, and learning. I draw inspiration from social sciences - economics, psychology, education, and human-computer interaction - to build agents that collaborate with people effectively. 

I am experienced principal investigator, having worked with various US government funding agencies including DARPA, AFOSR, ARPA-E, and NSF/NIH. My science contributions include fundamental advances in agent architectures as well as application of agent technology to real world usecases. My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence ([AIJ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0004370224000973), [JAIR](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352), [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), [IAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI17/paper/viewPaper/14963)), human cognition ([ICCM](https://iccm-conference.github.io/), [ACS](http://cogsys.org/journal/volume2/article-2-9.pdf), [BICA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212683X14000164)), human-machine interaction ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3375790) [TiiS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [IEEE RO-MAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9515448)) as well as in applications ([JMIR](https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/), [EMBC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7591428), [ACM/AAAI AIES](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271)).
