__Fundamental Research__: I led research on open-world learning agents ([DARPA SAIL-ON](https://intelligencecommunitynews.com/darpa-introduces-sail-on-program/)) and on teachable agents ([DARPA GAILA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/grounded-artificial-intelligence-language-acquisition)). Both these efforts study how agents can adapt to new situations, post-deployment, without the need of taking them offline and re-training. I study the role of structured representations in resilient agent architectures and investigate how they can be manipulated or adapted efficiently on-the-fly autonomously and with human instruction.       

__Applications__: I have built interactive, collaborative agents for a variety of domains including [patient-centric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00234), [preventative](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501) [healthcare](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [sustainable](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352) [living](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3563357.3567404), [general](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9515448) [purpose](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPaper/17261) [robots](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), and [augmented reality](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2327/IUI19WS-USER2AGENT-1.pdf).
